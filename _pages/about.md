I’m a Master student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, advised by [Noah A. Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My research aims at **interpretability**, **reasoning**, **robustness**, and **generalization**.

I am working on the [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/) team at [AI2](http://allenai.org/), and I completed my bachelar in NLP at the University of Washington.
