Hi! I’m a Master student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, advised by [Noah A. Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/). 

I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My research aims at **interpretability**, **multilingual**, and intersection between NLP and Linguistics. I completed my bachelar in Computer Science at the University of Washington.

<!-- In Winter 2021, I was the [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/) team at [AI2](http://allenai.org/), and I completed my bachelar in Computer Science at the University of Washington. -->
Thanks to the support of my research mentors, I am fortunate to conduct researcher during my college. I’m happy to help ambitious undergraduate students interested in natural language processing or machine learning get started with research --- please feel free to email me!
