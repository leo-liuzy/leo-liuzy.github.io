Hi! I’m a Master student in Computer Science at the University of Washington Seattle, where I am very fortunate to work with [Professor Noah A. Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) and [Professor Shane Steinert-Threlkeld](https://www.shane.st/).

In 2020, I completed my bachelar and happily spent my summer with [Professor Xuezhe Ma (Max)](https://xuezhemax.github.io). In 2021, I was a FAIR AI resident with [Dr. Xian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v_sIgawAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Veselin Stoyanov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdfWqboAAAAJ&hl=en), working in the FAIR Accelerator Project.

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (ML). In particular, I am interested in interpretability and modeling techniques of language models. Moreover, I am interested in Causal Inference and Representation Learning.

<!-- In Winter 2021, I was the [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/) team at [AI2](http://allenai.org/), and I completed my bachelar in Computer Science at the University of Washington. -->
Thanks to the support of my research mentors, I am fortunate to conduct researcher during my college. I’m happy to help ambitious undergraduate students interested in natural language processing or machine learning get started with research --- please feel free to email me!
